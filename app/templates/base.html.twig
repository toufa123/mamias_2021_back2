                <h5>3. How we process information about you</h5>
                The law requires that we process personal information under one of six defined bases and to notify
                you of the basis for each category. If a basis on which we process your personal information is no
                longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data. If the basis changes then,
                if required by law, we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have
                determined that we can continue to process your information.

                </p>
                <p>
                <h5>4. Information we process as a contractual obligation</h5>
                When you contact us about a service we provide as part of our business, create an account on our
                website (buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions) a
                contract is formed between you and us. Any processing of information that may lead to a
                contract - e.g. contacting us to enquire about a service or product - is also processed in this
                way as it may lead to a contractual obligation.

                In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us.
                Some of this information may be personal information. We may use it in order to:
                <ul>
                    <li>verify your identity for security purposes</li>
                    <li>sell products to you</li>
                    <li>provide you with our services</li>
                    <li>provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from
                        using our website
                    </li>
                </ul>
                We process this information on the basis there is a contract between you and us, or that you have
                requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.
                Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide information
                to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this
                purpose, you as an individual are not personally identifiable.

                </p>
                <p>
                <h5>5. Information we process with your consent</h5>
                Through certain actions when there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse
                our website or ask us to provide you with more information about our business, products or services,
                you are providing your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.

                Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information.
                Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by email
                to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.

                Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose,
                we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in
                a general way and use it to provide information, for example to monitor the performance of a
                particular page on our website.

                We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be
                reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.

                You may withdraw your consent at any time by <a href="{{ path('contact') }}">instructing us</a>, or by
                choosing to unsubscribe
                from emails that we send you.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h5> 6. Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests</h5>
                We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us,
                in doing so. Where we process your information on this basis, we do so after having given careful
                consideration to:
                <ul>
                    <li>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means</li>
                    <li>whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm</li>
                    <li>whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would consider it reasonable
                        to do so.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:
                <UL>
                    <li>record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our organisation/business</li>
                    <li>responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a
                        response
                    </li>
                    <li>protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party</li>
                    <li>insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage
                        organisational/business risk
                    </li>
                    <li>protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so</li>
                </UL>
                </p>
                <p>
                <h5>7. Sending a message via our website or contacting our support team</h5>
                When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website or by email, we collect the data
                you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need. We record your request and
                our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our business. We keep personally identifiable
                information associated with your message, such as your name and email address so as to be able
                to track our communications with you to provide a high quality service.

                If we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us. We use that
                information to resolve your complaint. If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact
                another party, we may decide to give that party some of the information contained in your
                complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion
                s to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.
